# Chapter 2: Working with Text Data

In this section, we try to understand and see the text data and how to handle with it. We also try to show how to prepare the text data to a language model.

### Here are the steps that we follow
- Understanding word embeddings
- Tokenizing text
- Converting tokens into token IDS
- Adding special context tokens
- Byte pair encoding
- Data sampling with a sliding window
- Creating token embeddings
- Encoding word positions

### Summary of the chapter
- LLMs require textual data to be converted into numerical vectors, known as embeddings, since they can’t process raw text. Embeddings transform discrete data (like words or images) into continuous vector spaces, making them compatible with neural network operations.
- As the first step, raw text is broken into tokens, which can be words or characters. Then, the tokens are converted into integer representations, termed token IDs.
- Special tokens, such as <|unk|> and <|endoftext|>, can be added to enhance the model’s understanding and handle various contexts, such as unknown words or marking the boundary between unrelated texts.
- The byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer used for LLMs like GPT-2 and GPT-3 can efficiently handle unknown words by breaking them down into subword units or individual characters.
- We use a sliding window approach on tokenized data to generate input–target pairs for LLM training.
- Embedding layers in PyTorch function as a lookup operation, retrieving vectors corresponding to token IDs. The resulting embedding vectors provide continuous representations of tokens, which is crucial for training deep learning models like LLMs.
- While token embeddings provide consistent vector representations for each token, they lack a sense of the token’s position in a sequence. To rectify this, two main types of positional embeddings exist: absolute and relative. OpenAI’s GPT models utilize absolute positional embeddings, which are added to the token embedding vectors and are optimized during the model training.
