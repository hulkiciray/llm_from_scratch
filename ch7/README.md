# Chapter 7: Fine-tuning to Follow Instructions
This sesssion covers another common fine-tuning method called instruction fine-tuning.
The purpose of this method is to <span style="color:orange;">improve conversational tasks</span>. The main technique behind that technology is instruction fine-tuning.

### Topics will be as follow:
